Incident.AffectedHost
With the introduction of the Alerts in MWG 7.1, we have introduced a product wide incident reporting and management system. Sounds a little scientific, but is a great benefit for the product. This allow you to build detailed alerting around MWG to receive emails and Traps, write special logs in case something goes wrong on MWG. Incidents are part of the rule engines properties and consist of:
 
Incident.AffectedHost
Incident.Description
Incident.ID
Incident.Origin
Incident.OriginName
Incident.Severity
 
Below, you have the description of the Properties
 
Description of the Incident Fields
 
Each of the following fields is put into a property and can be requested in the Log Handler.
 
IncidentID
 
The ID of the incident (unique).
Incidents:
From mwg-logmanager (origin 5) 
501 LogFilePushFailed
From System (origin 1) 
5 Monitor incident
Reason
 
A string describing the reason (no special format).
 
OriginID
 
The ID of the origin (unique).
Origins:
1 System
2 mwg-core
3 mwg-coordinator
4 mwg-antimalware
5 mwg-logmanager
6 sysconf daemon
7 mwg-ui
9 reserved for unidentified origins
OriginName
 
The name of the origin (should be something the admin knows from the UI, for example "Log File Manager" and not mwg-logmanager)
 
AffectedHost
 
A IP address describing the host that is affected
Examples:
a machine that downloads a lot of viruses
the fpt server that refuses the login credentials
any other machine that should be mentioned by the event
Severity
 
The severity of the event.
(Syslog severities)
