In order to file_hash to show up properly you MUST add the file_hash to your custom defined attribute

In your Gateway Antimalware with TIE rule make sure you have a rule as follows:

set file_hash
set event:
Set User-Defined.Antimalware.SHA1 = Antimalware.MATD.Hash<Gateway Anti-Malware with Tie>

Additionally in your "Block If Virus was Found" rule
add event:
Set User-Defined.Antimalware.SHA1 = Body.HashSHA1
Set User-Defined.Antimalware.MD5 = Body.Hash("md5")

the XML files assume that the userdefined Antimalware.SHA1 rule is set with values
