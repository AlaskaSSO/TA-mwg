#This line is needed to be on the indexer or heavy forwarder
#This is ONLY for re-writes of double-dates which occurs if you run through a system such as syslog-ng
#This is *NOT* required; it's only purpose is to reduce usage for your logs by approx 19 bytes a log
#This adds up massively with a large amount of logs
#syslog-ng always if configured will parse the timestamp provided by the MWG and set it's time to that time
#so the data is effectively double.
